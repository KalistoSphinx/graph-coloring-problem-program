# Graph Coloring Problem

Graph Coloring is the process of assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

+ The main goal is to use the minimum number of colors possible while ensuring this rule is followed.

+ This concept is used in timetabling, map coloring, register allocation, and network design.

This Repository contains the implementation of graph coloring problem in C++

The Program...

+ Accepts custom graph input (vertices, edges, adjacency matrix).

+ Finds all possible valid colorings.

+ Prints which vertex gets which color.

+ Displays the minimum number of colors required.

+ Demonstrates the backtracking approach.
